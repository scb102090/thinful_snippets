Popularity of various Uber drivers. 
yes- you can use a 5 star rating system (which is what they currently do)


A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. 
no - a survey would be good to guage whether they like the ice cream, but would be difficult to quantify how much, if using say a scale of 1-10. 
Would be better to just track sales of each flavor. 

Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people.
would need to be careful - gay respondents might be less likely to admit to their sexuality, and this might not answer, or answer differently.  
Would need to be a private survey (or in enviroment respondents feel comfortabnle). This might be the best option though, given the difficulty 
of getting this data in other forms. 

Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. 
You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going. 
no - It's tough to capture people's motivations in a survey, not to mention equating this to the increase. This might be more of a data sciecne 
modeling question, but the survey could be used to provide additional context. 

Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign. 
- No, I don't think that a survey would be a very good option to assessing the success rate of an advertising campaign. The
  main reason being that advertising campaigns typically take a while to produce results and a survey would have a hard time
  capturing the change or impact of the campaign. Things like focus groups might be better


Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.
no - not really sutiable for survey. This would be more of a data driven, observation based question ,
