    "# Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the information we were able to pull out of the text, one thing we didn't really use was semantics- the *meaning* of the words and sentences.  Our supervised learning model 'knows' that Jane Austen tends to use the word 'lady' a lot in her writing, and it may know (if you included parts of speech as features) that 'lady' is a noun, but it doesn't know what a lady is.  There is nothing in our work on NLP so far that would allow a model to say whether 'queen' or 'car' is more similar to 'lady.' \n",
    "\n",
    "This severely limits the applicability of our NLP skills!  In the absence of semantic information, models can get tripped up on things like synonyms ('milady' and 'lady'). We could modify the spaCy dictionary to include 'lady' as the lemma of 'milady,' then use lemmas for all our analyses, but for this to be an effective approach we would have to go through our entire corpus and identify all synonyms for all words by hand. This approach would also discard subtle differences in the connotations of (words, concepts, ideas, or emotions associated with) 'lady' (elicits thoughts of formal manners and England) and 'milady' (elicits thoughts of medieval ages and Rennaissance Faires).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, language is complicated, and trying to explicitly model all the information encoded in language is nearly impossibly complicated.  Fortunately, unsupervised modeling techniques, and particularly unsupervised neural networks, are perfect for this kind of task.  Rather than us 'telling' the model how language works and what each sentence means, we can feed the model a corpus of text and have it 'learn' the rules by identifying recurring patterns within the corpus.  Then we can use the trained unsupervised model to understand new sentences as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with supervised NLP, unsupervised models are limited by their corpus- an unsupervised model trained on a medical database is unlikely to know that 'lady' and 'milady' are similar, just as a model trained on Jane Austen wouldn't catch that 'Ehler-Danlos Syndrome' and 'joint hypermobility' describe the same medical condition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we are going to introduce Latent Semantic Analysis.  In the next, we will discuss unsupervised neural network applications for NLP.  \n",

    "# Converting sentences to vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"The best Monty Python sketch is the one about the dead parrot,  I laughed so hard.\"\n",
    "2. \"I laugh when I think about Python's Ministry of Silly Walks sketch, it is funny, funny, funny, the best!\"\n",
    "3. \"Chocolate is the best ice cream dessert topping, with a great taste.\"\n",
    "4. \"The Lumberjack Song is the funniest Monty Python bit: I can't think of it without laughing.\"\n",
    "5. \"I would rather put strawberries on my ice cream for dessert, they have the best taste.\"\n",
    "6. \"The taste of caramel is a fantastic accompaniment to tasty mint ice cream.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a human being, it's easy to see that the sentences involve two topics, comedy and ice cream.   One way to represent the sentences is in a term-document matrix, with a column for each sentence and a row for each word.  Ignoring the stop words 'the', 'is','and', 'a', 'of,','I', and 'about,', discarding words that occur only once, and reducing words like 'laughing' to their root form ('laugh'), the term-document matrix for these sentences would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "|           | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n",
    "|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Monty     | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| Python    | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| sketch    | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| laugh     | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| funny     | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "| best      | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| ice cream | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n",
    "| dessert   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| taste     | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we use the term 'document' to refer to the individual text chunks we are working with. It can sometimes mean sentences, sometimes paragraphs, and sometimes whole text files.  In our cases, each sentence is a document.  Also note that, contrary to how we usually operate, a term-document matrix has words as rows and documents as columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comedy sentences use the words: Python (3), laugh (3), Monty (2), sketch (2), funny (2), and best (2).\n",
    "The ice cream sentences use the words: ice cream (3), dessert (3), taste (3), and best (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The word 'best' stands out here- it appears in more sentences than any other word (4 of 6).  It is used equally to describe Monty Python and ice cream.  If we were to use this term-document matrix as-is to teach a computer to parse sentences, 'best' would end up as a significant identifier for both topics, and every time we gave the model a new sentence to identify that included 'best,' it would bring up both topics.  Not very useful.  To avoid this, we want to weight the matrix so that words that occur in many different sentences have lower weights than words that occur in fewer sentences.  We do want to put a floor on this though-- words that only occur once are totally useless for finding associations between sentences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another word that stands out is 'funny', which appears more often in the comedy sentences than any other word.  This suggests that 'funny' is a very important word for defining the 'comedy' topic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Quantifying documents: Collection and document frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "'Document frequency' counts how many sentences a word appears in.  'Collection frequency' counts how often a word appears, total, over all sentences.  Let's calculate the df and cf for our sentence set:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Penalizing Indiscriminate Words: Inverse Document Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's weight the document frequency so that words that occur less often (like 'sketch' and 'dessert') are more influential than words that occur a lot (like 'best').  We will calculate the ratio of total documents (N) divided by df, then take the log (base 2) of the ratio, to get our inverse document frequency number (idf) for each term (t):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$idf_t=log \\dfrac N{df_t}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The idf weights tell the model to consider 'best' as less important than other terms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Term-frequency weights\n",
    "The next piece of information to consider for our weights is how frequently a term appears within a sentence.  The word 'funny' appears three times in one sentence- it would be good if we were able to weight 'funny' so that the model knows that. We can accomplish this by creating unique weights for each sentence that combine the term frequency (how often a word appears within an individual document) with the idf, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tf-idf_{t,d}=(tf_{t,d})(idf_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the term 'funny' in sentence 2, where it occurs three times, will be weighted more heavily than the term 'funny' in sentence 1, where it only occurs once.  If 'best' had appeared multiple times in one sentence, it would also have a higher weight for that sentence, but the weight would be reduced by the idf term that takes into account that 'best' is a pretty common word in our collection of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf_idf score will be highest for a term that occurs a lot within a small number of sentences, and lowest for a word that occurs in most or all sentences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can represent each sentence as a vector made up of the tf-idf scores for each word:\n",

    "You can think of the tf-idf vectors as a 'translation' from human-readable language to computer-usable numeric form.

    "By now, you've had some practice thinking of data as existing in multi-dimensional space.  Our sentences exist in an n-dimensional space where n is equal to the number of terms in our term-document matrix.  To compute the similarity of our sentences to a new sentence, we transform the new sentence into a vector and place it in the space.  We can then calculate how different the angles are for our original vectors and the new vector, and identify the vector whose angle is closest to the new vector.  Typically this is done by calculating the cosine of the angle between the vectors.  If the two vectors are identical, the angle between them will be 0° and the cosine will be 1.  If the two vectors are orthogonal, with an angle of 90°, the cosine will be 0.  \n",

    "# Latent Semantic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool as this is, there are limitations to the VSM.  In particular, because it treats each word as distinct from every other word, it can run aground on *synonyms* (treating words that mean the same thing as though they are different, like big and large).  Also, because it treats all occurrences of a word as the same regardless of context, it can run aground on *polysemy*, where there are different meanings attached to the same word: 'I need a break' vs 'I break things.'  In addition, VSM has difficulty with very large documents because the more words a document has, the more opportunities it has to diverge from other documents in the space, making it difficult to see similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem is to reduce our tf-idf-weighted term-document matrix into a lower-dimensional space, that is, to express the information in the matrix using fewer rows by combining the information from multiple terms into one new row/dimension.  We do this using Principal Components Analysis, which you may recall from [an earlier assignment](https://courses.thinkful.com/data-201v1/assignment/2.1.6).  \n",
    "\n",
    "So Latent Semantic Analysis (also called Latent Semantic Indexing) is the process of applying PCA to a tf-idf term-document matrix.  What we get, in the end, is clusters of terms that presumably reflect a topic.  Each document will get a score for each topic, with higher scores indicating that the document is relevant to the topic.  Documents can pertain to more than one topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSA is handy when your corpus is too large to topically annotate by hand, or when you don't know what topics characterize your documents.  It is also useful as a way of creating features to be used in other models.\n",

       " '\" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ? I pity you . I thought you cleverer  for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .',\n",
       " '\" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .',\n",

       " '\" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton .',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him .',\n",

       " 'CHAPTER II',\n",
       " 'Mr . Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property .',\n",
       " 'Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .',\n",
       " 'Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune  though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate  was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .',\n",
       " \"Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .\",\n",
       " 'A complete change of life became desirable .',\n",
       " 'It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .',\n",
       " \"He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age .\",\n",
       " 'Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .',\n",
       " \"Now , upon his father ' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place .\",\n",
       " 'It was , indeed , a highly prized letter .',\n",
       " \"She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .\",\n",
       " \"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs . Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction  her more than satisfaction  her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor ,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .\",\n",
       " 'There was no recovering Miss Taylor  nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr . Woodhouse .',\n",
       " \"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr . Woodhouse would never believe it .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER III',\n",
       " 'Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .',\n",
       " \"Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr . Knightley ; and by Mr . Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr . Woodhouse ' s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .\",\n",
       " 'After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Goddard was the mistress of a School  not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems  and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity  but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies .',\n",
       " \"These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs . Weston .\",\n",
       " 'As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs . Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .',\n",
       " 'Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody .',\n",
       " 'She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired .',\n",
       " \"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging  not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk  and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .\",\n",
       " 'She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware .',\n",
       " 'Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .',\n",
       " 'Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :',\n",
       " '\" Mrs . Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs .',\n",
       " 'Emma allowed her father to talk  but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy .',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER IV',\n",
       " \"Harriet Smith ' s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing .\",\n",
       " 'Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .',\n",
       " 'Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation  and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole .',\n",
       " 'For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose .',\n",
       " 'With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .',\n",
       " '\" Well done , Mrs .',\n",
       " '\" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose  the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?',\n",
       " '\" Oh yes ! that is , no  I do not know  but I believe he has read a good deal  but not what you would think any thing of .',\n",
       " 'The next question was ',\n",
       " '\" What sort of looking man is Mr .',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " '\" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure .',\n",
       " '\" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .',\n",
       " '\" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day \\' s difference  which is very odd .\"',\n",
       " '\" Only four - and - twenty .',\n",
       " '\" Six years hence !',\n",
       " '\" Well , and that is as early as most men can afford to marry , who are not born to an independence .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure , so it is .',\n",
       " '\" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ; I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife  for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .',\n",
       " '\" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are .',\n",
       " '\" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure .',\n",
       " 'Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .',\n",
       " 'They met Mr . Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road .',\n",
       " 'They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .',\n",
       " '\" Only think of our happening to meet him ! How very odd !',\n",
       " '\" He is very plain , undoubtedly  remarkably plain : but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure ,\" said Harriet , in a mortified voice , \" he is not so genteel as real gentlemen .\"',\n",
       " '\" I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr . Martin .',\n",
       " '\" Certainly , he is not like Mr . Knightley .',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Knightley \\' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .',\n",
       " '\" Oh yes ! there is a great difference .',\n",
       " '\" Which makes his good manners the more valuable .',\n",
       " '\" There is no saying , indeed ,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly .',\n",
       " '\" But there may be pretty good guessing .',\n",
       " '\" Will he , indeed ?',\n",
       " '\" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended .',\n",
       " '\" I wonder he did not remember the book \" was all Harriet \\' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself .',\n",
       " '\" In one respect , perhaps , Mr . Elton \\' s manners are superior to Mr . Knightley \\' s or Mr . Weston \\' s .',\n",
       " 'She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr . Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr . Elton very agreeable .',\n",
       " \"Mr . Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ' s head .\",\n",
       " \"She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER V',\n",
       " '\" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs . Weston ,\" said Mr . Knightley , \" of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing .\"',\n",
       " '\" A bad thing !',\n",
       " '\" I think they will neither of them do the other any good .\"',\n",
       " '\" You surprize me !',\n",
       " '\" Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you , knowing Weston to be out , and that you must still fight your own battle .\"',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject .',\n",
       " '\" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old .',\n",
       " '\" I dare say ,\" replied Mrs . Weston , smiling , \" that I thought so _then_ ; but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma \\' s omitting to do any thing I wished .\"',\n",
       " '\" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,\" said Mr . Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done .',\n",
       " '\" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse \\' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .',\n",
       " '\" Yes ,\" said he , smiling .',\n",
       " '\" Thank you .',\n",
       " '\" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne .',\n",
       " '\" I hope not _that_ . It is not likely .',\n",
       " '\" Not I , indeed .',\n",
       " '\" I either depend more upon Emma \\' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .',\n",
       " '\" Oh !',\n",
       " '\" Pretty !',\n",
       " '\" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .',\n",

       " '\" I have not a fault to find with her person ,\" he replied .',\n",
       " '\" And I , Mr . Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm .',\n",
       " '\" Very well ; I will not plague you any more .',\n",
       " '\" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma \\' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith \\' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .',\n",
       " '\" Not at all ,\" cried he ; \" I am much obliged to you for it .',\n",
       " '\" Mrs . John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister .\"',\n",
       " '\" Be satisfied ,\" said he , \" I will not raise any outcry .',\n",
       " '\" So do I ,\" said Mrs . Weston gently , \" very much .\"',\n",
       " '\" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all .',\n",
       " '\" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ,\" said Mrs . Weston , \" as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse \\' s account .',\n",
       " \"Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr . Weston ' s on the subject , as much as possible .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER VI',\n",
       " \"Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr .

Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs . Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .',\n",
       " \"Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs . Goddard ' s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr .

Weston .',\n",

Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her \\' s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit ; but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being \" very cold , certainly very cold ,\" and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening .',\n",

But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination  such a passion for dining out  a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it  and this must be the case with Mr . Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked .',\n",

Goddard ' s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour .\",\n",

Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .',\n",

Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense  and had Mr . Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them .\"',\n",

       " 'It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life .',\n",
       " \"Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr . Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr . Elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .\",\n",
       " 'Harriet did think him all perfection , and maintained the non - existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness  and did , in truth , prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen ; but yet it appeared to her so natural , so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort _unrequited_ , that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force .',\n",
       " \"If Mr . Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .\",\n",

       " 'Their first pause was at the Crown Inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such ; but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place .',\n",

Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping  fearing  adoring  ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .\n",
